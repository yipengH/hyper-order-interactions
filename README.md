## 🧩 Overview

This project implements an extended Kuramoto model to study the effects of **hyper-order interactions (HpOI)** — competitive or cooperative relationships between high-order structures — on synchronization and bistability in complex networks.

**Main contributions:**
- Introduces HpOI to capture group-level coupling mechanisms
- Proposes a generalized Kuramoto model combining pairwise, high-order, and hyper-order interactions
- Uses theoretical analysis via **Ott–Antonsen reduction** and large-scale simulations
- Validates findings across synthetic and real-world networks
